# Game Programming With Python

You can write whole games in Python using PyGame. See a list of other PythonGameLibraries maintained in this Wiki, or this list maintained on DevMaster.net.
A full tutorial can be found in the free book "Making Games with Python & Pygame".
If you have an existing game and want to add a scripting engine to make it more flexible, Python is also a very good choice.
But you'll have to learn about IntegratingPythonWithOtherLanguages.

# Prerequisites
To be able to use this tutorial, make sure you have Python 3 and a programming environment already installed on your local computer or server.

You should also be familiar with the following Python programming concepts:
Importing modules,
Variables,
while loops,
for loops,
Conditional statements,
Boolean logical operators
With a programming environment set up and a familiarity with Python programming you are ready to begin working with pygame.
